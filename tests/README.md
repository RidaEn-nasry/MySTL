# !!!! IMPORTANT !!!!

The tests assumes all required member types and functions are defined and public.
otherwise the tests won't compile, the tests only check whether they yield the correct result
because there's not way to check whether a member is defined in a namespace other than to actually construct it,
urgo , compilation error if the stuff isn't there.
