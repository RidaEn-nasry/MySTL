> Through my project, I had the opportunity to delve deeper into the inner workings of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) containers. i tried implementing the containers using different data structures such as raw arrays, AVL trees, vectors, and red-black trees while considering the strengths and weaknesses of each. I gained practical knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and generic programming and how to apply these principles in implementing the STL containers.templates was an intresting aspect too, which are fundamental to the STL and enable generic programming by providing flexibility and reusability.  i enjoyed and was amazed by the composable design of STL with iterators, allocators, and adapters, which are crucial components of the STL that ensure its proper functioning. I tried implementing some generic algorithms to perform common container operations such as sorting, searching, and comparing while also customizing them for my project. Overall, the project was intresting and help me better understand the C++ STL library.
