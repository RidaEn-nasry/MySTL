>In this project, I learned how to implement my own versions of the C++ STL containers, including vector, map, stack, and set. I used advanced C++11 features, such as SFINAE and the keyword friend, to create more robust and efficient code. I also gained experience with implementing iterators, allocators, and non-member functions and overloads. In addition, I learned about the history of the STL and its creators, Alexander Stepanov and Meng Lee, who developed the library at Hewlett-Packard in the early 1990s. Overall, this project allowed me to deepen my understanding of the C++ STL containers and their implementation, and improve my skills as a C++ programmer.
